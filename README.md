# NSBEHacks - Leetcode Solver
### This is our submission for NSBE Hacks 2022 ###

Leetcode solver is a free tool aimed to help **BIPOC students get SWE jobs**, through practicing problems, and connecting with companies in the STEM field, to improve diversity and eliminate bias.

The service is **completely free** and runs on crowd-funding through donations. This lets leetcode solver be accessible to any student who may not be able to afford a premium Bootcamp.

The site works by simply entering in a leetcode problem, it will then automatically generate related videos, problems, and offer in-depth descriptions of that type of problem. 

Our project teaches students the **underlying concepts** of these problems, rather than just showing a solution, to better aid in the learning process.
